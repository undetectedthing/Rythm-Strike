Rhythm Strike
-
Rhythm Strike is the first-ever game that I published. Rhythm Strike is an FNF-style rhythm game that I just made for fun. There are some bugs with the files in the assets folder; they aren't being detected by the song or image api, but there is an alternative where you can choose your own song file (.mp3).
